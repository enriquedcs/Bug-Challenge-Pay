# Bug Challenge
**Author: Enrique A Decoss**

The purpose of this Repo is to solve the Bug challenge:

Find as many bugs/defects/flaws as you can in the UI and the API and create a  report. This report should be similar to what you would present to the developer of the application, with the type of detail that you would normally include.
